# Binary Class for Unsigned Integer Operations

This Java class, `Binary`, is designed to represent and perform operations on unsigned integer values in binary format. It provides a set of operations that can be performed on binary numbers, including addition, logical OR, logical AND, and multiplication.

## Features

- **Representation of Binary Numbers**: Store binary numbers as strings of '0's and '1's.
- **Addition**: Add two binary numbers.
- **Logical OR**: Perform the logical OR operation on two binary numbers.
- **Logical AND**: Perform the logical AND operation on two binary numbers.
- **Multiplication**: Multiply two binary numbers.

## Usage

### Creating a Binary Object

To create a new `Binary` object, pass a string of binary digits ('0's and '1's) to the constructor. If the string contains any characters other than '0' or '1', or is empty, the `Binary` object will default to "0".
